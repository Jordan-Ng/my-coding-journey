Monthly logs to document my coding progress

# April 2020
I have just completed a 10 week full-stack web development bootcamp at NEXT Academy. During my time at NEXT, I have learnt multiple programming skills such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, Github, Python, Flask and OOP (Object Oriented Programming). With what I have learnt, I was successful in building various web applications such as: Tic-Tac-Toe, Boggle, Roman Numerals, Nextagram (Instagram Clone). I have also teamed up with 4 full-stack web developers to build a fitness companion app, where I was responsible for maintaining both the front and back end logic to ensure functional components. 

--Goals--
While the curriculum at NEXT was fruitful, I have also realized that there is much to learn to hone my skills as a young full-stack developer. I am currently attempting challenges on Hackerrank (Javascript & python) and building single web page applications to hone my existing skills. I also wish to pick up new skills such as Redux and React Native. After all, a web developer never stops learning!
